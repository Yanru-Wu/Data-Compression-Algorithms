# Q-ary Huffman Encoding and Decoding

This repository contains Python scripts for Q-ary Huffman encoding and decoding. Q-ary Huffman coding is a generalization of binary Huffman coding, allowing for codes with a base (or alphabet size) of Q symbols. This can be useful for various applications where data is represented in a non-binary format.

## Files

* `q-ary_huffman_encoder.py`: This script takes an input text file (`input.txt`), builds a Q-ary Huffman tree, generates a Q-ary Huffman codebook, encodes the text, and saves the encoded text and the codebook to separate files. It also calculates and prints the entropy, average code length, and coding efficiency. The base `Q` can be configured within this script.
* `q-ary_huffman_decoder.py`: This script reads the encoded text (`q-ary_huffman_encode.txt`) and the codebook (`q-ary_huffman_codebook.txt`), decodes the text, and saves the decoded text to a new file (`q-ary_huffman_decode.txt`). It also performs an accuracy check against the original `input.txt` and measures the decoding time.
* `input.txt`: An example input file for the encoder. You should place the text you want to encode in this file.
* `q-ary_huffman_encode.txt`: (Generated by `q-ary_huffman_encoder.py`) Stores the Q-ary Huffman encoded string.
* `q-ary_huffman_codebook.txt`: (Generated by `q-ary_huffman_encoder.py`) Stores the generated Q-ary Huffman codebook (character to Q-ary code mapping).
* `q-ary_huffman_decode.txt`: (Generated by `q-ary_huffman_decoder.py`) Stores the decoded text.

## How to Use

1.  **Prepare your input:** Place the text you want to encode into `input.txt`.
2.  **Configure Q (Base):** Open `q-ary_huffman_encoder.py` and modify the `Q` variable to your desired base (e.g., `Q = 2` for binary, `Q = 3` for ternary, `Q = 5` as set by default, etc.).
    ```python
    # ===== User Config =====
    Q = 5  # Base-Q Huffman encoding, change this to your desired base (e.g., 2 for binary, 3 for ternary, etc.)
    # =======================
    ```
3.  **Encode the text:**
    ```bash
    python q-ary_huffman_encoder.py
    ```
    This will generate `q-ary_huffman_encode.txt` and `q-ary_huffman_codebook.txt`. It will also print encoding statistics (including the configured `Q` value, entropy, average code length, and efficiency) to the console.
4.  **Decode the text:**
    ```bash
    python q-ary_huffman_decoder.py
    ```
    This will read the encoded files, decode the text, save it to `q-ary_huffman_decode.txt`, and print decoding statistics (including accuracy and decoding time) to the console.

## Example Workflow

1.  Create an `input.txt` with content like:
    ```
    hello world
    ```
2.  (Optional) Open `q-ary_huffman_encoder.py` and set `Q = 3` for ternary encoding.
3.  Run `python q-ary_huffman_encoder.py`
    * `q-ary_huffman_encode.txt` will contain the Q-ary encoded string.
    * `q-ary_huffman_codebook.txt` will contain the character-to-Q-ary code mapping.
    * The console will show encoding statistics for the chosen base Q.
4.  Run `python q-ary_huffman_decoder.py`
    * `q-ary_huffman_decode.txt` will contain the decoded text, which should match `hello world`.
    * The console will show decoding statistics and confirm if the original text was restored.
