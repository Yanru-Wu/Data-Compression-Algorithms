# Shannon-Fano Encoding and Decoding

This repository contains Python scripts for Shannon-Fano encoding and decoding. Shannon-Fano coding is a technique for constructing a prefix code based on a set of symbols and their probabilities (or frequencies). It is an early method for lossless data compression.

## Files

* `shannon_encoder.py`: This script takes an input text file (`input.txt`), calculates symbol frequencies, generates a Shannon-Fano codebook, encodes the text, and saves the encoded text and the codebook to separate files. It also calculates and prints the entropy, average code length, and coding efficiency.
* `shannon_decoder.py`: This script reads the encoded text (`shannon_encode.txt`) and the codebook (`shannon_codebook.txt`), decodes the text, and saves the decoded text to a new file (`shannon_decode.txt`). It also performs an accuracy check against the original `input.txt` and measures the decoding time.
* `input.txt`: An example input file for the encoder. You should place the text you want to encode in this file.
* `shannon_encode.txt`: (Generated by `shannon_encoder.py`) Stores the Shannon-Fano encoded binary string.
* `shannon_codebook.txt`: (Generated by `shannon_encoder.py`) Stores the generated Shannon-Fano codebook (character to binary code mapping).
* `shannon_decode.txt`: (Generated by `shannon_decoder.py`) Stores the decoded text.

## How to Use

1.  **Prepare your input:** Place the text you want to encode into `input.txt`.
2.  **Encode the text:**
    ```bash
    python shannon_encoder.py
    ```
    This will generate `shannon_encode.txt` and `shannon_codebook.txt`. It will also print encoding statistics to the console.
3.  **Decode the text:**
    ```bash
    python shannon_decoder.py
    ```
    This will read the encoded files, decode the text, save it to `shannon_decode.txt`, and print decoding statistics and an accuracy check to the console.

## Example Workflow

1.  Create an `input.txt` with content like:
    ```
    hello world
    ```
2.  Run `python shannon_encoder.py`
    * `shannon_encode.txt` will contain the binary encoded string.
    * `shannon_codebook.txt` will contain the character-to-code mapping.
    * The console will show encoding statistics.
3.  Run `python shannon_decoder.py`
    * `shannon_decode.txt` will contain the decoded text, which should match `hello world`.
    * The console will show decoding statistics and confirm if the original text was restored.
